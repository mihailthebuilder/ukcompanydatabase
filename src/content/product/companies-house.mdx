Information available:

- corporate
- ownership
- financial

Can be accessed using 3 services:

- [web search](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/) - web portal where you can search by name, with various additional filters
- [API](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/) - developer-centric solution that enables applications to access slices of data
- [data products](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/companies-house-data-products) - another developer-friendly solution that provides data and account filings in bulk

**All of the data is provided at no cost.**

Drawbacks:

- the financial data has to be extracted from the filings
- the API and data products do not capture all of the data on the web portal
- no contact information available
